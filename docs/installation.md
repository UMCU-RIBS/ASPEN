`ASPEN` is pure python, so it can be installed on every platform if you have the correct dependencies.
Make sure if you have at least python 3.6 installed.
Then you can install it, by typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umcu-ribs/aspen.git
pip3 install -e aspen
```

## Dependencies

Required dependecies are:

* numpy
* scipy
* PyQt5 (including python3-pyqt5.qtsql)
* pandas
* wonambi

## Connect to database
To connect to a SQL database, you can do:

```bash
aspen
```
and then log in with the prompt screen. Or you can pass the credentials directly:

```bash
aspen --mysql DATABASE_NAME -U USERNAME
```

and you'll be prompted for the password.

If it's not on `localhost`, you can specify your hostname, called `HOSTNAME`:

```bash
aspen --mysql DATABASE_NAME -U USERNAME -H HOSTNAME
```
