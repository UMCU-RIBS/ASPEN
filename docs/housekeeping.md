## Allowed values
Possible values are stored in `tables.json` and also in the table `allowed_values`. 
The best way is to keep everything in `allowed_values` but we still depend on `tables.json` in some cases. 
I just need to clean the code for that.

For the time being, make sure that you add the values into `tables.json` and `allowed_values`.

### Constraints
You should make sure that for each `allowed_values`, there is a constraint in the corresponding table.
