## Recordings

### EPI recordings

  - **Multiband Acceleration Factor** (*Integer*): this is not stored in PAR/REC, so you need to specify the multiband factor.
  - **Phase Encoding Direction** (*Text*): this is not stored in PAR/REC, so you need to look it up in the examcard. In the Philips scanner, it's one letter (f.e. "P", "L"), but here it should specified as two letter ("AP", "RL").
